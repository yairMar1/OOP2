'''
 I added a message alert in an extreme case in several functions:
 follow, unfollow, publish_post.
 "An attempt to change the network when not connected to the network"

 In the "publish_post" function, if I hadn't used the "observer" formatting method,
 I would have written the two lines marked in the comment.
 They would have already sent all my followers a notification that I posted
